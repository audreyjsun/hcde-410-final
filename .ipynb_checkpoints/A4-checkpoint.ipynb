    "## Motivation and problem statement: \n",
    "I am planning on doing this analysis because I’ve always been curious about the impacts of social media on young minds and their mental health. I believe it could be useful in a very practical sense, learning about the negative effects of social media could bring awareness to how, as a consumer, I should be cautious in navigating these platforms and the ways they may be subconsciously affecting me. I hope to learn more about how social media is used amongst students, and how mental health has been impacted as a byproduct of this growing media. This specific time frame for the data sets (the 2010s) is particularly interesting to me because it really encapsulates the boom of social media. It’s important for me to also consider other factors, such as the greater general awareness of mental health when evaluating the data. But I hope to at least discover correlations within the data to further emphasize the unintentional consequences of social media. \n"

    "One factor that may impact my ability to complete this project is that mental health is a very complicated problem, that has many varying factors that can be impacting it. In drawing my conclusions, it may be difficult to come to an answer with certainty without fully delving into the other possible causes for these trends. With more time and resources, I would be curious to learn more about the impacting factors of anxiety, however in the time allotted, I’m unsure how well I will be able to document those aspects."
